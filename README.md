# Robotic-Arm-IK-in-Unity
Robotic Arm Immersive Kinetics in Unity for the Mixed-Reality Robot Teleoperation system.

Based on math and algorithm code samples by Alan Zucconi from https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/04/10/robotic-arms/

Practical application of said algorythm, controls setup and Unity scene by me.

This is the basic setting for the research project "A New Mixed-Reality-Based Robot Teleoperation System", such Unity program is also needed to be improved and combined with ROSbridge for the mixed-reality based robot arm Control.

Additionally, we are trying to use MLagents(https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) to train our robot and build an advanced scene like the "Reacher" one in Unity ML-agents.
